    "### Goals\n",
    "In this notebook, you're going to build a Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) that solves some of the stability issues with the GANs that you have been using up until this point. Specifically, you'll use a special kind of loss function known as the W-loss, where W stands for Wasserstein, and gradient penalties to prevent mode collapse.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Fun Fact: Wasserstein is named after a mathematician at Penn State, Leonid Vaseršteĭn. You'll see it abbreviated to W (e.g. WGAN, W-loss, W-distance).*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "1.   Get hands-on experience building a more stable GAN: Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP).\n",
    "2.   Train the more advanced WGAN-GP model.\n",

    "## Generator and Critic\n",
    "\n",
    "You will begin by importing some useful packages, defining visualization functions, building the generator, and building the critic. Since the changes for WGAN-GP are done to the loss function during training, you can simply reuse your previous GAN code for the generator and critic class. Remember that in WGAN-GP, you no longer use a discriminator that classifies fake and real as 0 and 1 but rather a critic that scores images with real numbers."
