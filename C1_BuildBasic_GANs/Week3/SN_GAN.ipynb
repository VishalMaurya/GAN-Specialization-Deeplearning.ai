    "# Spectrally Normalized Generative Adversarial Networks (SN-GAN)\n",

    "**Goals**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll learn about and implement **spectral normalization**, a weight normalization technique to stabilize the training of the discriminator, as proposed in [Spectral Normalization for Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05957) (Miyato et al. 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "As its name suggests, SN-GAN normalizes the weight matrices in the discriminator by their corresponding [spectral norm](https://calculus.subwiki.org/wiki/Spectral_norm#:~:text=The%20spectral%20norm%20of%20a,where%20denotes%20the%20Euclidean%20norm.), which helps control the Lipschitz constant of the discriminator. As you have learned with WGAN, [Lipschitz continuity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipschitz_continuity) is important in ensuring the boundedness of the optimal discriminator. In the WGAN case, this makes it so that the underlying W-loss function for the discriminator (or more precisely, the critic) is valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, spectral normalization helps improve stability and avoid vanishing gradient problems, such as mode collapse."
