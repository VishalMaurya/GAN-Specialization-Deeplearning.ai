    "### Goals\n",
    "In this notebook, you're going to make a conditional GAN in order to generate hand-written images of digits, conditioned on the digit to be generated (the class vector). This will let you choose what digit you want to generate.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll then do some exploration of the generated images to visualize what the noise and class vectors mean.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "1.   Learn the technical difference between a conditional and unconditional GAN.\n",
    "2.   Understand the distinction between the class and noise vector in a conditional GAN.\n",
    "\n"
